# ESP Web Server

In this project, I used ESP8266 as a web station and with an interface to control robot movement using JSON.

# Method of Work

After running the ESP, I can connect to its network using wifi
Then, I can open an html page which has five buttons: Forward, Right, Stop, Left, and Backward.
Using javascript, each button will return a value of '1' and using JSON I sent all directions values to the ESP.
